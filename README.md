# stock-prices-API
This API helps to get Current Indian Stock Market Price.
The need to develop it was felt when I could not find any free service that could provide developers with current market data. 

The API is lifetime free solution to developers.

Working:- 

Basically, The API fetches Market data from [Google Finance](https://google.com/finance) with the help of Web Scraping and then returns price in **JSON** Format making response developer friendly.

For Eg; 
`/price/sbicard` shall return current trading price of `SBICARD:NSE` Stock.
